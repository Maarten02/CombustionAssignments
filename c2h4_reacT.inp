!  Combustion example:
!
!     (a)  Combustion or assigned-enthalpy-and-pressure problem (hp).
!     (b)  Fuels are Jet-A(L)' at 298.15 K. The oxidant is air at 800 K.
!     (c)  Oxidant-to-fuel weight ratio is 15 (o/f =15).  Weight fractions are
!          fractions of fuel relative to total fuel and fractions of oxidant
!          relative to total oxidant.
!     (d)  Mixture enthalpy is calculated from reactant values given in 
!          thermo.lib. This is because data for these species are given in
!          thermo.lib and the species names match exactly.
!     (e)  Many species are omitted from the product data base ('omit' dataset).
!          Note:  these species names must match those used in thermo.lib.
!     (f)  Assigned pressures are 1, 10, and 50 bar (p(bar)= 1, 10, 50).
!     (g)  Mixture properties are to be printed in SI units (siunits).
!     (h)  Mole fractions > 1.e-10 are to be in e-format (trace=1.e-10).
